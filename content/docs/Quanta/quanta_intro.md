## What is Quanta?

Quanta is our proof-of-concept (POC) software that showcases the capabilities of Nautilus, demonstrating how decentralized applications (dApps) can operate securely using post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms. As a real-world implementation of Nautilus, Quanta provides developers and users with a functional prototype that leverages Nautilus' networking, security, and identity management features.

### How Quanta Works
Quanta is built entirely on Nautilus, meaning it inherits all the core functionalities of the framework, including:
- Decentralized Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Networking â€“ Secure communication without central servers.
- Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) â€“ Future-proof encryption and authentication methods.
- Identity & Authentication (DID) â€“ A decentralized identity system for user verification.
- Secure Messaging & File Transfer â€“ End-to-end encrypted data exchange between peers.

### Why Quanta?
Quanta serves as a practical demonstration of Nautilus' potential, providing:
- A working example for developers interested in building Nautilus-based dApps.
- A reference implementation for decentralized, secure messaging and file-sharing applications.
- An experimental environment for testing Nautilus' security and networking features.

### Key Features of Quanta
| Feature | Description |
|---------|------------|
| Built on Nautilus | Fully utilizes the Nautilus framework for networking, security, and authentication. |
| Decentralized Communication | Peer-to-peer connections without reliance on centralized servers. |
| Post-Quantum Encryption | Secure communication using PQC algorithms like Kyber, Dilithium, and Falcon. |
| Identity Verification | Uses Decentralized Identifiers (DID) to establish trust between users. |
