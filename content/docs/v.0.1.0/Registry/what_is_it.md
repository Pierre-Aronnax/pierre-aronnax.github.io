Nautilus Registry is a scalable, modular, and high-performance distributed registry designed to manage records across multiple storage backends. It supports in-memory and Redis-based storage, ensuring flexibility, fault tolerance, and efficient record retrieval.

This implementation is optimized for decentralized and high-availability applications, featuring sharding, consistent hashing, and adaptive storage management.

---

### Key Features

- Modular Storage Architecture – Supports both in-memory and Redis backends.
- Scalable Record Management – Uses consistent hashing for sharding across multiple storage nodes.
- Asynchronous & High-Performance – Built on Tokio for non-blocking registry operations.
- Expiration & Least Recently Used (LRU) Eviction – Automatically removes expired or least-used records.
- Error-Handled & Resilient – Implements robust error handling for registry failures.

### Core Components

| Module | Functionality |
| --- | --- |
| `record_trait.rs` | Defines generic record storage traits. |
| `registry_traits.rs` | Provides the core registry interface for managing records. |
| `registry_record_error.rs` | Defines error handling mechanisms for registry failures. |
| `in_memory_registry.rs` | Implements an in-memory registry with expiration and LRU eviction. |
| `redis_registry.rs` | Provides a Redis-backed registry for persistent storage. |
| `hashring_shard.rs` | Implements consistent hashing for sharded registries. |

Each module ensures scalability, fault tolerance, and efficient record management.

### How Nautilus Registry Works

#### 1️⃣ Record Storage & Retrieval

- Records are stored in either in-memory or Redis-based backends.
- Uses consistent hashing (`hashring_shard.rs`) to distribute records across multiple shards.
- Supports record expiration (`record_trait.rs`), automatically removing expired entries.

#### 2️⃣ Scalable & Fault-Tolerant Sharding

- Uses a consistent hashing mechanism to distribute records efficiently.
- If a storage shard fails, records can be redistributed dynamically.
- Global capacity enforcement ensures registry storage does not exceed limits.

#### 3️⃣ Asynchronous & Non-Blocking Operations

- Uses Tokio for async record management, reducing registry lookup latency.
- Supports batch processing of records for efficient bulk operations.
- Enables parallelized record access without blocking the system.

### Storage Backends & Their Use Cases

| Storage Backend | Best Use Case | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| In-Memory Registry (`in_memory_registry.rs`) | Fast, temporary record storage | ✅ Low latency, ✅ No external dependencies | ❌ Non-persistent, ❌ Data lost on restart |
| Redis Registry (`redis_registry.rs`) | Persistent, scalable record storage | ✅ High availability, ✅ Scalable | ❌ Requires Redis setup, ❌ Higher network overhead |

---

### Current Capabilities

✅ Implemented Features

- Asynchronous record storage & retrieval.
- Sharded registry management with consistent hashing.
- LRU eviction & expiration-based record cleanup.
- Fault tolerance via dynamic reallocation of records.

⚠️ Limitations & Future Enhancements

- ❌ No support for distributed coordination (e.g., Raft, Paxos).
- ❌ No cryptographic authentication of records.
- ❌ No built-in audit logging for record changes.
- ❌ No native multi-backend federation (planned for future updates).

### Why Use Nautilus Registry?

- Optimized for Scalable, High-Performance Applications – Designed for high-throughput registry operations.
- Flexible Storage Backend Support – Works with in-memory, Redis, and future-planned distributed stores.
- Fault-Tolerant & Self-Healing – Uses sharding and load balancing for high availability.
- Designed for Decentralized Applications – Ensures efficient, scalable record discovery.

Nautilus Registry is built to be the next-generation decentralized record management system, ensuring high availability, scalability, and security for modern applications.
