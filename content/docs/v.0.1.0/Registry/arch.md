Nautilus Registry is designed as a scalable, sharded registry system, supporting multiple storage backends while ensuring high availability and efficient record management. The architecture is modular, allowing seamless integration with different storage mechanisms like in-memory caching and Redis-based persistence.

The system follows a layered approach, separating record handling, storage management, and sharding logic, ensuring flexibility and extensibility for various deployment needs.

### Core Architectural Layers

#### 1️⃣ Record Management Layer (`record_trait.rs`)

- Defines the structure of stored records, including metadata, expiration policies, and identifiers.
- Provides a unified interface for different storage backends, ensuring modularity.
- Implements error handling (`registry_record_error.rs`) for consistency.

#### 2️⃣ Storage Backend Layer (`in_memory_registry.rs`, `redis_registry.rs`)

- Supports multiple storage backends, enabling flexibility in deployment.
- In-Memory Registry – Optimized for low-latency, temporary storage with LRU-based eviction.
- Redis Registry – Designed for persistent, high-availability storage with distributed support.
- Future extensibility allows integration with other distributed data stores.

#### 3️⃣ Sharding & Distribution Layer (`hashring_shard.rs`)

- Uses consistent hashing to distribute records across multiple registry nodes.
- Ensures even load balancing and dynamic record redistribution if a node fails.
- Provides fault tolerance by preventing registry overload and reducing bottlenecks.

#### 4️⃣ Asynchronous Processing Layer (`registry_traits.rs`)

- Implements non-blocking, concurrent registry operations using Tokio.
- Enables batch record processing for optimized bulk operations.
- Supports parallel queries without blocking network requests.

### How Nautilus Registry Operates

1. Record Storage & Retrieval – Records are stored in either in-memory or Redis-based registries with asynchronous lookup capabilities.
2. Sharding & Load Balancing – Consistent hashing ensures even record distribution across registry nodes.
3. Dynamic Expiry & Cleanup – Records automatically expire or follow LRU eviction policies based on configuration.
4. Resilient Failover Handling – If a registry shard fails, records are redistributed dynamically to ensure availability.

### Scalability & Future Enhancements

✅ Horizontal Scalability – Supports sharded storage, allowing nodes to scale independently.

✅ Dynamic Backend Switching – Can transition between in-memory and persistent storage without disruption.

✅ Security Enhancements (Planned) – Future updates will introduce record authentication & cryptographic verification.

✅ Multi-Backend Federation (Future Feature) – Will support multi-region distributed registries.

Nautilus Registry is built for efficiency, modularity, and fault tolerance, making it ideal for decentralized and large-scale registry management.
