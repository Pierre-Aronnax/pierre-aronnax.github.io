Nautilus Key Storage is constantly evolving to meet the needs of modern cryptographic security and key management. The roadmap is structured into multiple phases, each targeting specific improvements in security, performance, and feature expansion.

This roadmap outlines our current status, upcoming enhancements, and long-term goals.

---

## Current Status

Nautilus Key Storage currently provides a modular and extensible cryptographic key management solution with support for multiple storage backends.

### Supported Features

- Modular Storage Architecture – Easily integrates new storage backends.
- Multiple Storage Solutions – In-memory, file-based, OS keyring, and AWS KMS.
- Flexible Serialization – Supports JSON, PEM, and CBOR.
- Security-First Design – Uses OS-native security and encryption.

While the system is fully functional, several enhancements are planned to improve scalability, interoperability, and security.

## Upcoming Enhancements

The development roadmap is divided into three main phases, each introducing new capabilities.

### Phase 1: Security & Performance Optimization

- Improve Key Storage Encryption
  - Add AES-GCM encryption for file-based storage.
  - Enhance Linux Keyring and Windows DPAPI security layers.

- Performance Enhancements
  - Optimize key retrieval speed in cloud-based storage.
  - Implement batch key operations for better efficiency.

- Extended Cloud Support
  - Expand AWS KMS capabilities with automated key rotation.
  - Introduce Google Cloud KMS integration.

### Phase 2: Advanced Storage & Interoperability

- Multi-Signature & Threshold Storage
  - Support multi-signature storage solutions (e.g., Schnorr signatures).
  - Enable threshold cryptography for distributed key management.

- Hybrid Storage Solutions
  - Implement hybrid cloud + local storage for key redundancy.
  - Add encrypted key backups with automatic recovery.

- Expanded API & Integration
  - Provide WebAssembly (WASM) bindings for browser-based cryptographic operations.
  - Improve interoperability with OpenSSL and RustCrypto.

---

### Phase 3: Long-Term Innovation & Standardization

- Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) Integration
  - Explore zk-SNARKs & zk-STARKs for privacy-preserving authentication.
  - Implement anonymous credential schemes.

- Decentralized Key Management
  - Research decentralized identity (DID) and blockchain-based key storage.
  - Enable secure, self-sovereign key management.

- Post-Quantum Key Storage Standardization
  - Align with NIST PQC standardization efforts.
  - Improve certificate handling for hybrid cryptographic deployments.

---

## Why This Roadmap Matters

- Enhanced Security – Future-proofing against emerging threats.
- Improved Performance – Faster and more efficient key storage operations.
- Broader Compatibility – Support for new cloud providers and cryptographic frameworks.
- Innovative Features – Adoption of zero-knowledge proofs, threshold cryptography, and post-quantum security.

Each phase is designed to ensure Nautilus Key Storage remains a scalable, flexible, and high-security key management solution.
