Nautilus Key Storage is a secure and flexible cryptographic key management system that allows developers to store, retrieve, and manage cryptographic keys across multiple storage backends. It supports file-based, in-memory, cloud, and OS-secured key storage solutions, ensuring high levels of security, portability, and extensibility.

Key Features:
- Modular storage architecture – Easily swap or extend storage backends.
- Secure key handling – Uses encryption, OS-level protection, and cloud security mechanisms.
- Cross-platform support – Works on Linux, Windows, and cloud environments.
- Flexible serialization – Supports JSON, PEM, and CBOR formats.

## Architecture

Nautilus Key Storage is built on Rust traits, allowing different storage implementations to share a unified API. This modular approach ensures pluggability, enabling developers to integrate new storage solutions without modifying existing infrastructure.

### Core Components
1. KeyStorage Trait: Defines the standard API for saving, loading, removing, and listing keys.
2. Storage Backends: Provides in-memory, file-based, OS-specific, and cloud-based key storage.
3. File Formats: Supports JSON, PEM, and CBOR serialization for portability.
4. Error Handling: Standardized errors using `KeyStorageError` for consistent debugging.

## Supported Storage Backends

Nautilus Key Storage provides multiple backend implementations, ensuring that keys are stored securely while offering flexibility to choose the best method for a given application.

### In-Memory Key Storage
File: `in_memory_key_storage.rs`
- Fast, ephemeral storage using Rust's `HashMap`.
- Ideal for temporary key storage (e.g., session keys).

Limitations:
- Non-persistent – Keys disappear after application restart.

### File-Based Storage
File: `file_storage.rs`
- Saves keys to disk using JSON, PEM, or CBOR formats.
- Suitable for offline key management.

Limitations:
- File I/O overhead – Slower than in-memory storage.

### OS-Secured Storage

Nautilus Key Storage supports OS-native secure storage mechanisms, ensuring that cryptographic keys are stored using built-in platform security features. This provides stronger access control, encryption, and tamper protection compared to traditional file-based storage.

#### Supported OS Storage Mechanisms

| Operating System | Storage Mechanism | Description |
|----------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Linux | `linux-keyutils` (via `linux_keyring_storage.rs`) | Uses the Linux Key Retention Service (`keyctl`) to store keys securely within user-defined keyrings. This prevents unauthorized access and avoids persistent file storage. |
| Windows | Windows Credential Manager (via `windows_key_ring_storage.rs`) | Stores cryptographic keys within the Windows KeyRing (`CRED_TYPE_GENERIC`), ensuring secure access control via user authentication. |
| Windows | Windows Trusted Security Module (TSM) (via `windows_tsm_storage.rs`) | Uses Windows Data Protection API (DPAPI) to encrypt and store keys securely on disk, preventing unauthorized extraction. |

#### Advantages of OS-Secured Storage
- Enhanced Security – Keys are protected using OS-level security policies.
- Access Control – Keys are only accessible to authorized users and processes.
- No Manual Encryption Needed – OS storage mechanisms handle encryption internally.

#### Limitations
- OS-Dependent – Storage methods vary across operating systems and are not cross-platform.
- Limited Portability – Keys stored using OS-native mechanisms cannot be easily transferred between different environments.

This approach is ideal for applications requiring long-term key security without relying on external encryption mechanisms. However, for cross-platform key sharing, file-based or cloud storage solutions may be preferred.

### Cloud-Based Storage (AWS KMS)
File: `amazon_s3_storage.rs`
- Uses Amazon Key Management Service (AWS KMS).
- Ideal for secure, scalable cloud-based key management.

Limitations:
- Requires AWS authentication.
- Limited control over key expiration policies.

## Security & Encryption

Nautilus Key Storage follows best security practices to ensure key confidentiality and integrity.

- OS-Level Security: Uses Windows DPAPI, Linux KeyUtils, and AWS KMS for strong encryption.
- Data Encryption: Supports AES-based encryption for file-based storage.
- Access Control: Role-based security when using AWS KMS.
- Tamper Protection: Prevents unauthorized key modifications.

## Why Use Nautilus Key Storage?

- Flexible & Extensible – Add new storage backends with minimal effort.
- Secure by Design – Uses industry-standard encryption and OS-level security.
- Cross-Platform Compatibility – Works seamlessly on Linux, Windows, and cloud platforms.
- Developer-Friendly API – Simple and efficient key management interface.
