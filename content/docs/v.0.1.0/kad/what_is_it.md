Nautilus KAD is a Rust-based Kademlia Distributed Hash Table (DHT) implementation, designed for decentralized, efficient, and fault-tolerant peer-to-peer networks. It enables peer discovery, distributed storage, and efficient node routing by leveraging the Kademlia algorithm.

---

## Key Features

- Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Network – No reliance on central servers.
- Efficient Routing with XOR Distance – Finds nodes in `O(log(n))` lookups.
- Bootstrap & Peer Discovery – Nodes self-organize and locate peers dynamically.
- Asynchronous & Scalable – Uses Tokio for concurrency, enabling high performance.
- Self-Healing Network – Nodes adapt to failures by refreshing routing tables.

## Architecture & Core Components

| Module | Functionality |
| --- | --- |
| `kad_protocol.rs`​ | Core Kademlia protocol, handles peer communication. |
| `kad_message.rs`​ | Defines message types (`Ping`, `FindNode`, `Store`, etc.). |
| `routing_table.rs`​ | Manages peer organization using XOR distance buckets. |
| `node.rs`​ | Defines Node structure with NodeID and network address. |
| `xor_distance.rs`​ | Implements XOR distance metric for efficient lookups. |
| `bootstrap.rs`​ | Handles bootstrap process for new peers joining the network. |
| `utils.rs`​ | Provides utility functions like random node ID generation. |

Each module works together to create a scalable, fault-tolerant distributed network.

## How Nautilus KAD Works

1. Joining the Network
    - A new node must bootstrap by discovering peers via a known node (`bootstrap.rs`).
    - The node initializes its routing table (`routing_table.rs`).
2. Node Lookup (FindNode Query)
    - When searching for a key, the node finds closest peers using XOR distance (`xor_distance.rs`).
    - Uses an iterative lookup strategy to refine results (`kad_protocol.rs`).
3. Storing & Retrieving Data
    - The `Store` message stores values on the closest K nodes.
    - The `FindValue` query retrieves data efficiently.
4. Network Maintenance & Self-Healing
    - Nodes periodically refresh buckets and remove inactive peers (`routing_table.rs`).
    - The system ensures resilience by redistributing lost data.

## Current Capabilities

✅ Implemented Features

- Bootstrap & Peer Discovery – Nodes locate initial peers dynamically.
- Efficient Lookup with XOR Distance – Fast peer discovery in `O(log(n))`.
- Message Serialization – Uses `bincode` & `serde` for compact encoding (`kad_message.rs`).
- Routing Table with Bucket Management – Organizes peers based on proximity (`routing_table.rs`).
- Self-Healing Mechanism – Automatically removes stale nodes.

⚠️ Limitations & Future Enhancements

- ❌ No NAT Traversal – Cannot bypass firewalls or routers yet.
- ❌ No Data Redundancy & Replication – Lacks multi-node storage for fault tolerance.
- ❌ No Cryptographic Authentication – No signatures to verify message authenticity.
- ❌ No Support for Large-Scale DHT Queries – Optimizations required for large networks.

## Why Use Nautilus KAD?

- Optimized for Rust – Unlike existing Kademlia implementations, this is asynchronous, lightweight, and performant.
- Highly Extensible – Modular design allows custom storage layers, cryptographic enhancements, and scalability improvements.
- Decentralized & Resilient – No single point of failure, making it ideal for Web3, P2P networks, and distributed applications.
