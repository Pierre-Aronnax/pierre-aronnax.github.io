Nautilus V.0.1.0 is a decentralized framework designed to support secure, scalable, and high-performance applications. It integrates cryptographic security, decentralized identity management, and networking protocols to facilitate trustless and resilient decentralized applications (dApps).

The architecture is structured to prioritize security, decentralization, interoperability, and modularity, making it adaptable to various use cases, including Web3 applications, secure communication networks, and privacy-preserving systems.

## Core Architecture

Nautilus consists of four key layers, each serving a distinct purpose:

| Layer | Description |
|-------|------------|
| Cryptographic Layer | Implements PKI, Key Management, and Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) for identity security and communication. |
| Identity & Security Layer | Provides Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Verifiable Credentials (VCs), and secure authentication mechanisms. |
| Networking & Communication | Ensures peer-to-peer networking via Kademlia DHT, TLS encryption, and mDNS for discovery. |
| Application & Integration | Facilitates developer APIs, blockchain connectivity, and decentralized storage integrations. |

These layers are designed to work seamlessly together to deliver a trustworthy, scalable, and resilient decentralized environment.

## Cryptographic Foundation

Security is at the core of Nautilus, leveraging both classical and post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms. The cryptographic layer supports:

- Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC): Kyber, Falcon, Dilithium, SPHINCS+.
- Traditional Cryptography: RSA, ECDSA, Ed25519, SECP256K1.
- Key Exchange & Secure Communication: Hybrid cryptographic key management.

These cryptographic methods are implemented through a modular design, ensuring flexibility and future-proof security.

## Decentralized Identity & Security

The identity and security layer ensures self-sovereign identity through DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs), enabling trustless authentication in decentralized systems. Secure key storage mechanisms protect private cryptographic assets, enhancing overall security.

This layer integrates Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and multi-factor authentication techniques, ensuring a robust foundation for privacy-preserving user authentication.

---

## Secure Networking & Communication

Nautilus supports secure peer-to-peer (P2P) communication through Kademlia Distributed Hash Table (DHT), ensuring decentralized, efficient data routing.

It also incorporates TLS-based encrypted communication and mDNS for service discovery, allowing secure, resilient, and highly available decentralized networking.

---

## Application & Integration

The application layer provides a developer-friendly API that enables seamless integration with blockchain networks, Web3 technologies, and decentralized storage solutions.

The modular framework allows for plugin-based extensions, facilitating custom security tools, additional cryptographic schemes, and interoperability with external services.

---

## Future Enhancements

To further enhance security and scalability, the roadmap for Nautilus includes:

- Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) Authentication
- Quantum-Resistant Digital Signatures
- Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) Enhancements
- Integration with Decentralized Storage Solutions (IPFS, Filecoin)

These advancements will ensure that Nautilus remains at the forefront of secure, decentralized computing.
