Nautilus TLS is a Rust-based secure communication protocol designed to provide encrypted transport, authentication, and key exchange for secure connections. Unlike traditional TLS implementations, Nautilus TLS is optimized for asynchronous Rust applications, offering a modular and customizable security framework.

This implementation includes a handshake mechanism, encrypted data transmission, and session management, making it suitable for secure peer-to-peer communication, decentralized applications, and post-quantum security protocols.

### Key Features

- Asynchronous & Non-Blocking – Built on `Tokio` for efficient concurrent handling of secure connections.
- Post-Quantum Secure Handshake – Uses Kyber for quantum-resistant key exchange.
- Customizable Cipher Suites – Supports AES-GCM encryption for secure data transmission.
- Session Management & Key Derivation – Handles secure session negotiation and key establishment.
- Peer-to-Peer Secure Messaging – Enables authenticated & encrypted communication in distributed systems.

### Core Components

| Module | Functionality |
| --- | --- |
| `connection.rs` | Manages secure TCP connections, read/write operations. |
| `handshake.rs` | Implements the TLS handshake using Kyber key exchange. |
| `tls_state.rs` | Tracks session state, cipher suites, and encryption keys. |
| `tls_session.rs` | Manages TLS session lifecycle, including adaptive session initiation. |
| `record.rs` | Encrypts, decrypts, and serializes TLS records. |

Each module plays a role in ensuring secure and efficient encrypted communication.

### How Nautilus TLS Works

#### 1️⃣ Establishing a Secure Connection

- A client and server initiate a handshake to authenticate and exchange session keys.
- The handshake uses Kyber (a post-quantum key exchange algorithm) to establish a shared secret.
- The session key is then used for encrypting data transmission.

#### 2️⃣ Data Encryption & Transmission

- Each message is encrypted using AES-GCM before being sent over the network.
- Messages are encapsulated in TLS records, which are serialized and sent securely.
- The receiving side decrypts the record using the shared session key.

#### 3️⃣ Session & State Management

- TlsState maintains the session key, cipher suite, and handshake status.
- TlsSession manages long-lived secure connections between peers.
- Adaptive session initiation enables nodes to act as either clients or servers dynamically.

### Security Features

✅ Post-Quantum Key Exchange (Kyber-1024) – Provides resistance against quantum attacks.

✅ AES-GCM Encryption for Data Confidentiality – Ensures low-latency, high-security encryption.

✅ Mutual Authentication – Verifies both parties before establishing a connection.

✅ Session Key Rotation (Planned) – Enhances security by periodically refreshing encryption keys.

✅ Zero-Knowledge Proofs (Future Enhancement) – Strengthens authentication without exposing private keys.

### Current Capabilities

✅ Implemented Features

- Secure TLS handshake with Kyber-based key exchange.
- Encrypted data transmission using AES-GCM.
- Session key management for maintaining long-lived secure connections.
- Efficient, event-driven architecture built with Tokio.

⚠️ Limitations & Future Enhancements

- ❌ Lacks forward secrecy (planned for future updates).
- ❌ No multi-cipher suite negotiation (currently fixed to Kyber + AES-GCM).
- ❌ Limited interoperability with standard TLS implementations.

### Why Use Nautilus TLS?

- Optimized for Decentralized Applications – Ideal for peer-to-peer and blockchain-based systems.
- Post-Quantum Security – Uses Kyber for key exchange, making it future-proof.
- Asynchronous & High-Performance – Fully Tokio-based, ensuring efficient concurrent connections.
- Modular & Extensible – Developers can extend or modify encryption methods without breaking compatibility.

Nautilus TLS provides next-generation secure communication while ensuring modularity, performance, and forward compatibility with post-quantum cryptographic standards.
