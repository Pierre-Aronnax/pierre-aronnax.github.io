Nautilus TLS follows a layered architecture, ensuring a clear separation between handshake negotiation, session management, encrypted data transmission, and connection handling. This modular approach allows for scalability, security enhancements, and future extensibility while maintaining high performance in asynchronous environments.

### Core Architectural Layers

#### 1️⃣ Connection Layer (`connection.rs`)

- Manages TCP-based secure communication.
- Handles sending and receiving of encrypted records.
- Integrates with the TLS session for stateful encryption/decryption.

#### 2️⃣ Handshake Layer (`handshake.rs`)

- Implements the TLS handshake protocol using Kyber for post-quantum key exchange.
- Performs mutual authentication between peers before session establishment.
- Establishes a shared encryption key, ensuring secure data exchange.

#### 3️⃣ Record Layer (`record.rs`)

- Encapsulates and encrypts all transmitted data.
- Uses AEAD (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data) with AES-GCM.
- Prevents replay attacks and tampering with secure message integrity verification.

#### 4️⃣ Session & State Management (`tls_session.rs`, `tls_state.rs`)

- Maintains active session keys and encryption parameters.
- Handles session resumption and expiration for optimized performance.
- Stores negotiated cipher suites and protocol state.

### How Nautilus TLS Operates

1. Connection Initiation – A client connects to a server via the connection layer, initiating a secure handshake.
2. Key Exchange & Handshake – The handshake layer performs Kyber-based key exchange, deriving a shared session key.
3. Session Establishment – The session state is configured, including cipher suite selection and encryption settings.
4. Secure Data Transmission – The record layer encrypts messages using AES-GCM and transmits them securely.
5. Session Management – Active connections are maintained in the session layer, with support for future key rotation.

### Design Considerations & Future Enhancements

- Decentralized Compatibility – Can be adapted for peer-to-peer and Web3 applications.
- Post-Quantum Ready – Future-proofed against quantum-based cryptographic attacks.
- Pluggable Cipher Suites – Will support multiple encryption options beyond AES-GCM.
- Forward Secrecy (Planned) – Ensuring session keys remain secure even if a long-term key is compromised.
- Session Resumption Optimization – Reducing handshake overhead for persistent connections.
