Nautilus TLS is a functional, post-quantum-ready TLS implementation with:

- Kyber-based Key Exchange – Provides quantum-resistant secure session establishment.
- AES-GCM Encrypted Data Transmission – Ensures low-latency, high-security message encryption.
- Asynchronous Architecture – Built on Tokio for efficient, concurrent secure connections.
- Session Management – Tracks cipher suites, encryption keys, and handshake states.

### Limitations & Areas for Improvement

- No Forward Secrecy – Needs ephemeral key exchange mechanisms.
- No Session Resumption – Handshakes occur on every connection, increasing latency.
- Limited Cipher Suite Support – Currently fixed to Kyber + AES-GCM, with no flexibility.
- No Transport-Layer Integration – Cannot yet integrate with QUIC or UDP-based protocols.

---

### Phase 1: Core Enhancements

- Session Resumption & Optimization
    - Introduce session tickets for faster reconnections without full handshakes.
    - Optimize session caching to minimize computation overhead.
- Configurable Cipher Suites
    - Extend support for ChaCha20-Poly1305 & post-quantum encryption.
    - Enable pluggable cipher suite negotiation between peers.

---

### Phase 2: Security & Performance Upgrades

- Forward Secrecy (Ephemeral Key Exchange)
    - Implement Diffie-Hellman-based key exchange with frequent key rotations.
    - Ensure session key confidentiality, even if long-term keys are compromised.
- Transport-Layer Integration (TLS over QUIC)
    - Enable Nautilus TLS over QUIC, improving performance for real-time & low-latency applications.
    - Implement UDP-based encrypted transport, making TLS more adaptable for decentralized networks.
- Zero-Knowledge Proof Authentication (Experimental)
    - Introduce ZKP-based authentication to verify identities without revealing sensitive information.
    - Strengthen privacy & resistance against man-in-the-middle attacks.

---

### Phase 3: Advanced Features & Long-Term Scalability

- Decentralized Identity Integration
    - Support DID (Decentralized Identifiers) for peer authentication.
    - Enable blockchain-backed certificate verification.
- Quantum-Safe Encryption & Hybrid Protocols
    - Implement post-quantum encryption algorithms beyond Kyber (e.g., FrodoKEM, BIKE).
    - Support hybrid encryption models, combining classical & post-quantum security.
- AI-Optimized Cipher Negotiation
    - Use machine learning to optimize cipher suite selection based on network conditions.
    - Automate adaptive security levels based on risk assessment.

### Conclusion

The Nautilus TLS roadmap is focused on enhancing security, performance, and scalability, making it a future-proof TLS implementation for modern, decentralized, and post-quantum applications.
