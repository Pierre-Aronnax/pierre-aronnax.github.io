# Roadmap

## Current Status

Nautilus PKI has established a secure and modular cryptographic framework, supporting both classical and post-quantum cryptographic schemes. Our current implementation includes:

### Supported Schemes

| Category       | Algorithms |
|--------------------|---------------|
| Key Exchange   | RSA-OAEP, ECDH (SECP256K1, P-256), Kyber |
| Digital Signatures | RSA, ECDSA, Ed25519, Falcon, Dilithium, SPHINCS+ |
| Hashing | SHA-256, SHA-512, Shake256, BLAKE2b |
| Key Serialization | DER, PEM, CBOR |

### Key Strengths of the Current System
- Modular design: Cryptographic schemes can be easily swapped or extended using Rust traits.
- Hybrid cryptographic support: Supports classical and post-quantum algorithms.
- Interoperability: Works with TLS, OpenPGP, and modern security frameworks.
- Benchmarking & testing: Comprehensive performance analysis tools.

## Future Roadmap

Our roadmap is structured into three phases to ensure continuous improvements in security, performance, and interoperability.

### Phase 1: Security & Optimization
- Performance Optimizations

  - Reduce key generation and signing latency for post-quantum algorithms.
  - Implement batch verification for Ed25519, ECDSA, and Falcon to improve efficiency.

- Security Hardening

  - Strengthen resistance to side-channel attacks using constant-time implementations.
  - Improve randomness sources for cryptographic key generation.

- Expanded Benchmarking

  - Optimize key exchange throughput using memory-efficient algorithms.
  - Add fuzz testing to detect vulnerabilities in key serialization.

### Phase 2: Advanced Features & Interoperability
- Multi-Signature & Threshold Cryptography

  - Implement multi-signature support (e.g., Schnorr signatures) for enhanced transaction security.
  - Introduce threshold signatures to enable distributed key management.

- Hybrid Key Exchange Implementation

  - Combine Kyber with classical ECDH for enhanced post-quantum resilience.
  - Enable support for hybrid TLS handshakes.

- Expanded API & Integration

  - Provide WebAssembly (WASM) bindings for browser-based cryptographic operations.
  - Improve integration with OpenSSL & RustCrypto libraries.

---

### Phase 3: Long-Term Innovation & Future Cryptography

- Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) Integration

  - Explore zk-SNARKs & zk-STARKs for privacy-preserving authentication.
  - Implement anonymous credential schemes.

- Post-Quantum PKI Standardization

  - Align with NIST PQC standardization efforts.
  - Improve certificate handling for hybrid cryptographic deployments.

- Quantum-Secure Identity Solutions

  - Research lattice-based identity authentication.
  - Develop secure decentralized identity (DID) mechanisms.

## Conclusion

Our roadmap focuses on enhancing security, expanding features, and future-proofing Nautilus PKI against evolving threats. By combining post-quantum security, multi-signature support, and hybrid key exchange, we aim to build a resilient and scalable cryptographic infrastructure.
