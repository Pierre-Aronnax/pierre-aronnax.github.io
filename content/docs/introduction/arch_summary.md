## Overview

Nautilus is designed as a decentralized communication and identity management framework. It integrates networking, cryptography, and secure storage to provide a resilient and scalable system.

### Key Components

1. **Networking Layer** - Implements mDNS, Kademlia DHT, and WebRTC for peer discovery and communication.
2. **Identity Management** - Uses Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials for authentication.
3. **Storage System** - Hybrid model leveraging local, cloud, and IPFS-based decentralized storage.
4. **Security Mechanisms** - Post-quantum cryptography, TLS-secured transport, and secure enclave-based key storage.

## Component Interactions

Each of these modules communicates using an event-driven microservices approach, ensuring interoperability and modularity across various deployment environments.
