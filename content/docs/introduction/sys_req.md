## System Requirements

For optimal performance, Nautilus requires specific hardware and software configurations based on deployment needs.

### **Hardware Requirements**

| Deployment Type       | CPU        | RAM        | Storage  |
|----------------------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Personal Use         | 2 Cores   | 2GB RAM   | 10GB     |
| Mid-Scale Business  | 4 Cores   | 4GB RAM   | 20GB     |
| Enterprise Deployment | 8+ Cores | 16GB+ RAM | 100GB+   |

### **Software Requirements**

- **Operating Systems**:
  - Windows 10+ (64-bit)
  - Ubuntu 20.04+
  - macOS Catalina+ (Planned)
  - Android/iOS (Future support planned)

- **Development Dependencies**:
  - Rust (v1.84 or later) with Cargo
  - Tauri (for frontend integration)
  - WebRTC and WebSockets (for real-time communication)

- **Security Dependencies**:
  - Post-Quantum Cryptographic Libraries (Kyber, Dilithium, Falcon)
  - Symmetric Encryption (AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305)
  - Key Derivation Functions (Argon2, PBKDF2)

By following these requirements, Nautilus ensures robust security, optimal performance, and seamless deployment across different environments.
