It enables scalable, fault-tolerant, and low-latency network communication, making it ideal for Web3 applications, decentralized storage, and P2P networks.\nThe system structures nodes in a distributed overlay network, where each node is responsible for routing, storing, and retrieving data based on XOR distance calculations.\nCore Components of Nautilus KAD kad_protocol.rs – Handles Kademlia query logic, including FindNode, FindValue, and Store operations. kad_message.rs – Defines the message format for communication between nodes. routing_table.rs – Manages peer organization using XOR distance-based buckets. xor_distance.rs – Implements the XOR metric to determine which nodes are closest to a given target. node.rs – Represents a network node with a unique NodeID and network address. bootstrap.rs – Manages the bootstrap process for new nodes joining the network. utils.rs – Provides helper functions such as random NodeID generation. How Nautilus KAD Works Bootstrapping \u0026amp; Peer Discovery A new node must connect to at least one known peer to join the network. The bootstrap node provides a list of active peers, allowing the new node to populate its routing table. XOR Distance \u0026amp; Routing Nautilus KAD determines node proximity using XOR distance calculations. Nodes maintain a routing table structured into buckets, each containing peers at increasing XOR distances. Queries are routed progressively closer to the target, ensuring efficient lookups in O(log(n)) time. Storing \u0026amp; Retrieving Data Data is stored on the K closest nodes to a given key using a Store message. To retrieve stored data, a node sends a FindValue query, which iteratively searches through the network until the data is found. Self-Healing \u0026amp; Network Maintenance Nodes periodically refresh routing tables to remove inactive peers. If a node leaves the network, its stored data is redistributed among other nodes to maintain availability. Routing Table \u0026amp; XOR Distance Calculation Nautilus KAD uses binary XOR distance to determine which nodes are closest to a given key. Each node organizes peers into buckets based on their XOR distance from itself. Closer nodes are stored in more frequently accessed buckets, optimizing search performance. Example Calculation:\nIf Node A has the ID 101010 and Node B has the ID 110110:\nXOR(101010, 110110) = 011100 (Binary) Distance = 28 (Decimal)\rA query is routed through the closest nodes first, progressively moving towards the target.\nMessage Types \u0026amp; Network Communication Ping – Ensures a node is still active. FindNode – Requests the closest nodes to a given target. FindValue – Searches for a stored value within the network. Store – Saves a value on the K closest nodes to a given key. All messages are serialized using bincode + serde, ensuring compact and efficient transmission.\nCurrent Capabilities Implemented Features:\nFully decentralized peer-to-peer routing. Efficient XOR distance-based lookups. Self-healing network that removes inactive peers automatically. Compact, fast message serialization using bincode + serde.

How Nautilus DID Works Nautilus DID operates on three main pillars:\nDID Management – Creating, updating, and resolving DIDs. Verifiable Credentials (VCs) – Issuing and verifying digital credentials. Cryptographic Key Management – Secure key storage and signing. 1. DID Management DIDs are unique decentralized identifiers that allow users to prove ownership of their identities.\nA typical DID Document contains:\nPublic keys for cryptographic authentication. Service endpoints for secure communication. Authentication mechanisms for identity proof. Example of a DID Document:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;did:nautilus:123456\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;publicKeys\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;did:nautilus:123456#key-1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Ed25519VerificationKey\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;controller\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;did:nautilus:123456\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;publicKeyBase64\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;bG9yZW0gaXBzdW0gZG9sb3I=\u0026#34; } ], \u0026#34;authentication\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;did:nautilus:123456#auth-1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Ed25519Signature\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;controller\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;did:nautilus:123456\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;publicKey\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;did:nautilus:123456#key-1\u0026#34; } ] }\r2. Verifiable Credentials (VCs) Verifiable credentials are digitally signed identity claims that allow individuals to prove attributes about themselves (e.g., citizenship, academic degrees, age verification).\nEach credential is:\nSigned using a DID for authenticity. Tamper-proof due to cryptographic signatures. Verifiable without contacting the issuer.
